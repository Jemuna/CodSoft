# 📊 Sales Prediction using Python

This project aims to build a **Sales Prediction Model** using Machine Learning techniques in Python. The dataset includes advertising spend data across TV, Radio, and Newspaper, and the goal is to predict product sales based on these features.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Businesses invest in multiple advertising channels, but how do they know which one impacts their sales the most?  
Using data and machine learning, this project helps predict future sales and optimize advertising strategies.

## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Columns**:
  - `TV`: Advertising budget spent on TV (in thousands of dollars)
  - `Radio`: Advertising budget spent on Radio
  - `Newspaper`: Advertising budget spent on Newspaper
  - `Sales`: Sales of the product (target variable)

- **Shape**: 200 rows × 4 columns

---

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Train-Test Split, Model Evaluation)

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. Load the dataset
2. Data cleaning & exploration
3. Data visualization (EDA)
4. Train-test split
5. Apply Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate model using R² Score, MAE, MSE
7. Visualize predictions vs actual

---

## 🔎 Model Performance

- Metrics Used:
  - **R² Score**
  - **Mean Absolute Error**
  - **Mean Squared Error**
- Visualization of predicted vs actual sales using regression line plot

---

## 📊 Sample Output

- Predicted Sales for given ad spend values
- R² Score: ~0.89 (approximate, depends on split)
- Visual graph comparing predictions

---

## 🤖 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how basic machine learning models can be used to help businesses make better budget decisions for their marketing campaigns.
