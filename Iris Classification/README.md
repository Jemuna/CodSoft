# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify **Iris flowers** into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — using machine learning techniques in Python.

## 📘 Dataset Overview

The **Iris dataset** is one of the most well-known datasets in the data science community. It includes 150 samples with the following features:

- `sepal length (cm)`
- `sepal width (cm)`
- `petal length (cm)`
- `petal width (cm)`
- `species` (target)

## 🧠 Objective

To build a **classification model** that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

## ⚙️ Steps Followed

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Load the Iris dataset
   - Check data types, null values, and distribution
   - Visualize feature relationships using pairplots and histograms

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Label encode the species column
   - Feature scaling if necessary

3. **Model Building**
   - Train-Test Split
   - Use algorithms like:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - KNN
     - Support Vector Machine

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

## 📈 Results

The models achieved an accuracy of **95%+**, with **SVM and KNN** performing exceptionally well on the test set.

## 📊 Visualization Highlights

- Pairplots showing cluster separation
- Heatmap of correlation matrix
- Confusion matrix for classification clarity
